		<h1>Connor Dillane</h1>
		<p>My name is Connor Dillane and I am a senior at SUNY Oswego. I have a major in Communication and Social Interactions and a minor in Graphic Design. I am very new to code and the process of coding, so I am quite intimidated, but I'm sure with the help of my teacher, TA, and classmates I will be able to prevail and learn the basics of coding.</p>
